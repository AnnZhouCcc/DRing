LEAFSPINE
y spine switches, 4y racks (leaf switches), 3y svrs/rack
Topologies for y = 8, 12, 16, 20, 24
x: number of svrs/rack, x=3y



RRG
same hardware as leafspine topologies


DRING
12 supernodes (supernode==sn) in all topologies, switches divided roughly equally among all supernodes.
The number of switches and degree is same as leafspine topologies.
Each DRing topology has 2-3% fewer servers than the corresponding leafspine topology.
